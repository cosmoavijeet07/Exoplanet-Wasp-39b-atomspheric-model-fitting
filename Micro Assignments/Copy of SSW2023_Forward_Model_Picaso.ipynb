Cross sections are computed by using line lists in combination with critical molecular pressure broadening parameters. Both can either be derived from theoretical first principles (e.g. [UCL ExoMol's line lists](https://www.exomol.com/)), measured in a lab, and/or some combination thereof (e.g. [HITRAN/HITEMP line lists](https://hitran.org/)).\n","\n","When cross sections are initially computed, a resolution ($\\lambda/\\Delta \\lambda$) is assumed. Cross sections are computed on a line-by-line nature and therefore usually computed for R~1e6. For JWST we are often interested in large bands (e.g. 1-14 $\\mu$m). Therefore we need creative ways to speed up these runs. You will usually find one of two methods: correlated-k tables, and resampled cross sections. [Garland et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03997.pdf) is a good resource on the differences between these two.\n","\n","For this demonstration we will use the resampled cross section method. **The major thing to note about using resampled cross sections** is that you have to compute your model at ~100x higher resolution that your data.

Congrats! You've made it to the end. What is next?\n","\n","# Final Project Description\n","\n","In the tutorial you will have learned how to create a forward model, and analyze it's output. You then learned how to build up the complexity of your forward model from isothermal pressure-temperature models with equilibrium chemistry, to a full radiative-convective model. And finally, you learned how to add clouds in two ways: 1) by using a grey cloud and 2) by computing a cloud model using the Ackerman & Marley (Virga) framework. Ultimately, this allowed you to build up a model that fit the WASP-39b spectrum. One piece that was given to you in this tutorial were the ranges of values. For example, we only explored a single M/H, C/O correlated-K model. You were supplied kzz, fseds to explore for the Virga modeling. Additionally, we only explored three abundances of SO2. Lucky for this case, we were highly informed by the literature! However in most cases, you will have to be much more generous with your grids. For the final project, use all the same principles of this tutorial to build a grid of radiative convective models with post-processed clouds and SO2 chemistry. The free parameters of your radiative convective model should be M/H, and C/O. You can keep the other climate parameters fixed, as we have done here unless you are feeling adventurous and would like to expand your grid to include the head redistribution (rfacv) and the intrinsic (also called internal) temperature. Extended Data Table 2 in [Alderson et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10488.pdf) is a great resource to help guide the parameters of your grid. Once you have a grid of radiative-convective models, first use them to create \"cloud free\" transmission spectra. Next, create a \"cloudy\" grid that includes Virga clouds. Similarly, you can use [Alderson et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10488.pdf) as a resource to guide your choice of fsed and kzz. Once you have your cloud-free and cloudy grids.  Your cloud-free grid will be equal to the number of radiative-convective models you ran, your cloudy grid will be # RC models x # fseds x # of Kzzs. Finally! After you are all done with your grid use the simple chisq technique to find the \"minimum chi-sq\" model when you do and do not include clouds.\n","\n","Tips!\n","1.
