According to Bayes' theorem, the probability, $P$, of a hypothesis, $H$, given a set of observations, $\\mathbf{X}$, and a collection of prior knowledge, $I$, is given by\n","\\begin{equation*}\n","    P(H|\\mathbf{X},I) = \\frac{P(\\mathbf{X}|H,I) P(H|I)}{P(\\mathbf{X}|I)},\n","\\end{equation*}\n","where $|$ reads as \"given\" (that all terms to the right are assumed true), and the comma reads as \"and\". The power of Bayes' theorem is that it allows us to compute the *posterior probability*, $P(H|\\mathbf{X},I)$, using the much more easily calculable *likelihood function*, $P(\\mathbf{X}|H,I)$, which is the probability that we would have observed the data $\\mathbf{X}$ if the hypothesis and prior knowledge were correct. The $P(H|I)$ term is the *prior probability* and summarizes how our prior knowledge affects our hypothesis before having measured the data $\\mathbf{X}$. Finally, the $P(\\mathbf{X}|I)$ term is the *evidence* or *marginal likelihood* and is often omitted when fitting a model to data as it is only a normalization term and does not depend on the hypothesis.\n","\n","When fitting a set of observations, a hypothesis typically consists of a function describing the model which depends on a collection of parameters, $\\theta$, and hyperparameters, $\\alpha$. Bayes' theorem can then be re-written as\n","\\begin{equation*}\n","    P(\\theta|\\mathbf{X},\\alpha) \\propto P(\\mathbf{X}|\\theta,\\alpha) P(\\theta|\\alpha).\n","\\end{equation*}\n","Fitting the observations usually starts by freezing the set of hyperparameters and then evaluating the posterior probability by comparing different model predictions to the observed data. Fitting the observations then requires determining the values of $\\theta$ that maximize the posterior probability (called the Maximum A Posteriori estimate or MAP estimate), while determining the uncertainty on the model parameters involves determining the range of values of $\\theta$ that provide an adequately good fit to the observations (called the confidence interval).\n","\n","In principle, one could simultaneously estimate the optimal value of $\\theta$ and its confidence interval from the posterior probability density function (PDF) by calculating the posterior probability for all values of $\\theta$; this is called a grid search. While this technique may be feasible for discrete parameters or low dimensional problems, performing a grid search when the vector $\\theta$ contains tens or thousands of continuous variables becomes immensely challenging and computationally inefficient. Instead, various algorithms can be used to compute the MAP estimate and the confidence interval, some of which we will make use of in this workshop."],"metadata":{"id":"seVhRGioPDrg"},"id":"seVhRGioPDrg"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Optimizing a fit to the white lightcurve\n","\n","In this section, we are going to find the MAP (often called \"best-fit\") model parameter values by fitting a \"white\" lightcurve using an optimization algorithm. As was discussed in Workshop #1, by \"white\" we mean wavelength-integrated, where the MIRI wavelengths used here span 5–10.5 micrometers.\n","\n","Estimating the best-fit values of the parameters $\\theta$ is often done using a gradient descent algorithm. This technique starts by picking either a random or partially informed initial estimate for the value of $\\theta$ and then computing or estimating the gradient in the posterior PDF depending on whether or not the model is differentiable. In practice, most optimization methods are formulated as minimization routines (hence the name gradient *descent*), so it is more common to seek the minimum of the *negative* posterior probability. The algorithm will then take a small step in the direction in which the posterior probability most rapidly increases and then re-evaluate the gradient in the posterior PDF. This procedure is then repeated (typically with a gradually decreasing step size) until the algorithm locates a local maximum in the posterior PDF. The distinction of a local maximum rather than a global maximum is important as gradient descent routines do not explore the parameter space as thoroughly as a grid search, so it is possible for the algorithm to settle on a local maximum which compares poorly to the global maximum. This is typically overcome by running several gradient descent optimizations initialized at random locations in parameter space in the hopes that one of the optimizations will make its way to the global maximum (or at least alert you to the presence of many local maxima). As we'll see later, the posterior for the fits we'll be making in this workshop is pretty smooth, so we'll just run a single optimization run."],"metadata":{"id":"enuzxOfS9jpV"},"id":"enuzxOfS9jpV"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Setting the Stage 5 \"Eureka!

Set `verbose` to `True` so you get lots of useful information printed out.\n","4. Set `fit_method` to `[lsq]` to use the [scipy.optimize.minimize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html) algorithm to **minimize** the **negative** log-probability in order to find the best-fit values for each fitted parameter.\n","5. Set `run_myfuncs` to `[batman_tr, polynomial, ypos, ywidth]`. Each element in this list is a function that will be fitted to the data — we'll setup more aspects of each function below when we setup the \"Eureka! Parameter File\". The `batman_tr` function uses the [batman](http://lkreidberg.github.io/batman/docs/html/index.html) package to model a transit function which describes how the astrophysical flux decreases when the planet passes in front of its star blocks part of the star's light. The `polynomial` function allows us to fit for systematic trends in time (like a linear slope) as well as fitting for the overall baseline flux level; you must always use a `polynomial` model when fitting observations to at least model the baseline flux level. The `ypos` and `ywidth` functions model changes in the flux caused by changes in the position and PSF width of the spectrum on the detector in the spatial direction; we computed these during Stage 3 in Workshop #1. JWST is quite stable over time, so these functions just assume that the flux is linearly correlated with the spatial position and PSF width. Not all observations require that you use the `ypos` and `ywidth` functions, but as we saw in Workshop #1 there is a strong mirror-tilt event in these observations, as we are going to use `ypos` and `ywidth` to try to remove that sudden jump in flux.\n","6.

Set `lsq_method` to `Powell`. This controls which scipy.optimize.minimize optimization method will be used. In general, the Powell algorithm works very well.\n","10. Set `lsq_tol` to `1e-6`.

A value of `1e-6` will suffice for most datasets.\n","11. Leave `lsq_maxiter` at its default setting of `None`. This parameter can be used to let the optimzation routine run for longer if you get a message saying that the fit failed because the maximum number of function evaluations has been exceeded.

Navigate to the [NASA Exoplanet Archive's page](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/overview/WASP-39b) about our target WASP-39b and click on \"WASP-39 b Planetary Parameters\". We will use the values published by Maciejewski et al. 2016 as priors. Where there are two values for the uncertainty, just use the larger of the two. Also, while the published `t0` is in units of BJD_TDB, JWST timestamps are in units of B**M**JD_TDB, where the M means \"modified\" and BMJD_TDB=BJD_TDB-2400000.5; this removes the first two digits that won't change in our lifetime and changes the time so that a new BMJD_TDB day starts at midnight (while new BJD_TDB days inconventiently start at noon). So we will need to subtract that 2400000.5 from the published `t0` value when entering it into your EPF. And since the planet is consistent with a zero-eccentricity orbit, let's set `ecc` to be fixed to 0 and arbitrarily set `w` to be fixed to 90 (the value of `w` doesn't matter if the eccentricity is zero).

However, this is the main value that we are hoping to measure with our observations and we want to be able to see how the radius changes with wavelength. As a result, we will greatly increase the uncertainty on the radius to `0.01` in order to minimally bias our observations.

A convenient and efficient way of modelling this limb-darkening was published in [Kipping (2013)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.435.2152K/abstract). With this limb-darkening law, there are two parameters to be fitted and each can theoretically take on any value between 0 and 1.

These two parameters control the `polynomial` function we specified in the ECF settings above. To make things easier, Eureka! normalizes the lightcurves by the median flux, so the value of `c0` should be approximately 1, but since our observations have such a large transit it will be a bit above 1. The value of `c1` is in the units of change in `c0` per day, and is typically very small (the absolute value of `c1` is typically at or below 0.001. Reasonable, minimally informative priors could then be:\n","  > `c0 1 'free' 1 0.01 N`<br/>\n","  > `c1 0 'free' 0 0.01 N`\n","  - `ypos` which assumes the observed flux varies linearly with the position on the detector.

Values for `ywidth` can sometimes reach as high as ~1, so a reasonable, minimally informative prior could then be:\n","  > `ywidth 0 'free' 0 10 N`\n","\n","- We also need to setup `scatter_mult`. Eureka! estimates the expected level of noise from photon-limited statistics, but data is imperfect and we rarely ever reach the photon-limited noise level (because of background noise, read noise, and other systematic noise sources). If you fit data with underestimated error bars, then the resulting confidence intervals can be artificially small, so we want to inflate the error bars on our observations as is justified by the data. The simplest way to do this with Eureka! is the `scatter_mult` parameter which multiplies the error bars by a constant factor. A fitted value of 2 for `scatter_mult` would mean that the observed scatter in the data is twice as high as it would be in the photon-limited noise regime.

However, this technique can give inaccurate estimates especially in the presence of correlations between different parameters. Instead, a sampling algorithm like the Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) method is typically used to estimate parameter uncertainties. Monte-Carlo (MC) methods in general involve randomly sampling values of $\\theta$, while MCMCs are a specific variant where samples are randomly drawn based on the knowledge of the posterior probability from the previously drawn value; the draws of MCMC are typically called steps taken by a walker, and a collection of many walker steps are called a chain.\n","\n","One increasingly popular sampling algorithm is called [Nested Sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_sampling_algorithm) which does not necessarily use a MCMC method. Nested sampling can be difficult to explain intuitively, but one of the nice advantages to nested sampling is that it can be used for model comparison.

For reliable results, this must be greater than `ndim * (ndim + 1) // 2`, where `ndim` is the number of fitted parameters and `//` indicates integer division.
